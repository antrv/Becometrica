           * A code-completion string that describes "optional" text that
           * could be a part of the template (but is not required).
           *
           * The Optional chunk is the only kind of chunk that has a code-completion
           * string for its representation, which is accessible via
           * \c clang_getCompletionChunkCompletionString(). The code-completion string
           * describes an additional part of the template that is completely optional.
           * For example, optional chunks can be used to describe the placeholders for
           * arguments that match up with defaulted function parameters, e.g. given:
           *
           * \code
           * void f(int x, float y = 3.14, double z = 2.71828);
           * \endcode
           *
           * The code-completion string for this function would contain:
           *   - a TypedText chunk for "f".
           *   - a LeftParen chunk for "(".
           *   - a Placeholder chunk for "int x"
           *   - an Optional chunk containing the remaining defaulted arguments, e.g.,
           *       - a Comma chunk for ","
           *       - a Placeholder chunk for "float y"
           *       - an Optional chunk containing the last defaulted argument:
           *           - a Comma chunk for ","
           *           - a Placeholder chunk for "double z"
           *   - a RightParen chunk for ")"
           *
           * There are many ways to handle Optional chunks. Two simple approaches are:
           *   - Completely ignore optional chunks, in which case the template for the
           *     function "f" would only include the first parameter ("int x").
           *   - Fully expand all optional chunks, in which case the template for the
           *     function "f" would have all of the parameters.
